This PR was automatically generated by the [Upstream Sync workflow](.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml).

**Upstream repository:** https://github.com/mapbox/earcut  
**Previous synced commit:** [\`${LAST:0:7}\`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/${LAST})  
**New upstream commit:** [\`${LATEST:0:7}\`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/${LATEST})  
**Compare:** https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/compare/${LAST}...${LATEST}

### Upstream commits included

${{ steps.diff.outputs.COMMITS }}

### What to do

The complete upstream repository at the new commit has been mirrored into \`.upstream/\` so you can diff every changed file side-by-side:

1. Review the full upstream diff: https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/compare/${LAST}...${LATEST}
2. Port algorithm changes from \`.upstream/src/earcut.js\` to \`src/Earcut/Earcut.cs\` using [PORTING_GUIDE.md](PORTING_GUIDE.md).
3. If test fixtures were added/changed in \`.upstream/test/fixtures/\`, copy them to \`test/Earcut.Tests/fixtures/\` and update \`test/Earcut.Tests/expected.json\`.
4. Run \`dotnet test\` and ensure all tests pass.
5. Update \`PORTING_GUIDE.md\` if new language patterns were introduced.
