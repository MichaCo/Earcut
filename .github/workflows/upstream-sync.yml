This PR was automatically generated by the [Upstream Sync workflow](.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml).

**Upstream repository:** https://github.com/mapbox/earcut  
**Previous synced commit:** [\`${LAST:0:7}\`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/${LAST})  
**New upstream commit:** [\`${LATEST:0:7}\`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/${LATEST})  
**Compare:** https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/compare/${LAST}...${LATEST}

### Upstream commits included

${{ steps.diff.outputs.COMMITS }}

### What to do

1. Review the upstream diff: https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/compare/${LAST}...${LATEST}
2. The updated \`src/earcut.js\` has been placed in \`.upstream/earcut.js\` for reference.
3. Port any algorithm changes from \`.upstream/earcut.js\` to \`src/Earcut/Earcut.cs\` using the [PORTING_GUIDE.md](PORTING_GUIDE.md).
4. If new test fixtures were added upstream, add them to \`test/Earcut.Tests/fixtures/\` and update \`test/Earcut.Tests/expected.json\`.
5. Run \`dotnet test\` and ensure all tests pass.
6. Update \`PORTING_GUIDE.md\` if new language patterns were introduced.
