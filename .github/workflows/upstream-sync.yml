          ## Upstream Sync Task

          @Copilot please port the upstream changes listed below to C# and open a pull request.

          New commits have been pushed to [mapbox/earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) since the last sync.

          **Previous synced commit:** [`LAST_SHA`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/LAST_FULL)
          **New upstream commit:** [`LATEST_SHA`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/commit/LATEST_FULL)
          **Full diff:** https://github.com/mapbox/earcut/compare/LAST_FULL...LATEST_FULL

          ### What to port

          Please port all upstream changes to C# and open a pull request. Follow the [PORTING_GUIDE.md](PORTING_GUIDE.md) for language mapping conventions.

          Key files to check in the upstream diff:
          - `src/earcut.js` → port any algorithm changes to `src/Earcut/Earcut.cs`
          - `test/fixtures/*.json` → copy any new/changed fixtures to `test/Earcut.Tests/fixtures/`
          - `test/expected.json` → update `test/Earcut.Tests/expected.json` to match

          After porting:
          1. Run `dotnet test` and ensure all tests pass
          2. Update `PORTING_GUIDE.md` if new language patterns were introduced
